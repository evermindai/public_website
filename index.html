                    <p>Evermind AI harnesses smart game AI technology to transform neurodivergence identification and support. Our mission is to help every child thrive in a society that recognises and meets their needs. Our flagship iPad-based games analyse motor patterns linked to autistic and ADHD traits, offering meaningful insights to guide support. Funded by Innovate UK, we are now piloting this solution across UK schools to help teachers understand learner diversity and give every child the best possible educational experience.</p>

                    <h2>Neurodiversity Assessment</h2>
                    <p>Our smart assessment feels like simple, enjoyable play on an iPad. Children draw shapes, colour them in, and share food between friendly cartoon characters — games that take around fifteen minutes and require no special expertise from the examiner. Beneath this playful surface, advanced AI analyses how each child moves and interacts with the screen, revealing subtle motor patterns that reflect their unique way of processing information and interacting with the environment. This natural and non-judgmental approach is designed to let every child show how their mind works while having fun.</p>

                    <h2>From Lab to Practice</h2>
                    <p>The technology was developed in collaboration between the University of Strathclyde’s <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/innovationinautism/">Laboratory for Innovation in Autism</a> and international partners, led by Prof Jonathan Delafield-Butt. Built on more than a decade of research and £3 million in funding, our algorithms were trained on data from over 1,200 children and validated in a multicentre Phase 3 study on autism identification across Scotland and Sweden, using previously unseen datasets. This high-quality, ethically sourced evidence base underpins the reliability of our results and distinguishes Evermind AI from competitors.</p>

                    <p>We are now running the pilot feasibility study in UK education, funded by Innovate UK. Schools and nurseries are invited to collaborate in exploring how early insights into neurodiversity can enrich learning and inclusion. We are also seeking business and organisational partners who share our commitment to ethical, evidence-based innovation in neurodiversity and child development. Together, we can lay the foundations for a future where every child’s individuality is recognised and supported.</p>
